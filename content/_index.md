# Welcome

I invest in early stage technology companies around computing and software.

Occasionally also non-tech companies with interesting products and value propositions.

If you want to learn more, feel free to reach out to me.

If I invest, I provide hands on support in various stages and degrees of engagement.
Amongst other

- hiring staff (engineers, your CTO, CPO, etc.)
- vetting and sparing technological choices
- help during due diligence
- actually writing software

Odds are you are running into problems that I've solved before.

My background is largely in SaaS software development across the fintech and logtech sector with a strong business mindset and network.

Startup experience ranges from...

- being the first technical employee in a small 10 people fintech, to heading the entire engineering department to helping the founders into the exit

... to ...

- being a serial founder and CTO in various startups from 3 people to 25, from 0 to 1 to exit

Corporate experience ranges from...

- Post acquisition integration of startups (specifically product and engineering teams)

... to ...

- acting principal engineer at corporate business
